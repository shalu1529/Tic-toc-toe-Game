# Tic-toc-toe-Game
This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Java. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 
grid with their respective symbols (usually X and O), aiming to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.

Technologies Used:
Java: The game is implemented in Java, making use of core Java features such as classes, methods, and arrays.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Utilizes OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to organize and structure the code.
Console Input/Output: Relies on console input/output for user interaction and displaying the game state.

How to Play:
To play the game, simply run the Main.java file in your Java development environment. Follow the prompts in the console to input your moves and take turns playing against another player. 
The game will continue until one player wins or the board is filled with no winner.
